# Tom Morello – Everything Burns

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Never had a choice,
never let the opps win
Calm them nerves,
got the whole world watchin'
Ready, set, go,
and there ain't no stoppin'
Only one option, light it up
Ha!
Heart is poundin' out my chest,
the blood boils inside of me
Lookin' at the walls around
me closin' in, I think,
"What's it gonna be?"
Never had a choice,
never let the opps win
Calm them nerves,
got the whole world watchin'
Ready, set, go,
and there ain't no stoppin'
Only one option, light it up
Everything burns
Light it up, let's go,
light it up, let's go
Everything burns
Light it up, let's go,
light it up, let's go
I'm on fire,
burnin' brighter than
anyone alive
I'm way too hot to touch,
so just remember if you try
Everything burns
Everything burns
Bones are shakin' out my skin,
I got tinglin' in my hands
Movin' like a lightning strike,
I'm on tonight,
so just catch me if you can
Never had a choice,
never let the opps win
Calm them nerves,
got the whole world watchin'
Ready, set, go,
and there ain't no stoppin'
Only one option, light it up
Everything burns
Light it up, let's go,
light it up, let's go
Everything burns
Light it up, let's go,
light it up, let's go
I'm on fire,
burnin' brighter than
anyone alive
I'm way too hot to touch,
so just remember if you try
Everything burns
Whole house packed,
not here to make friends
Do or die moment,
I love it this tense
Who am I takin' out?
Thinking you're next
And now when the sky turns red,
'cause everything burns
'Cause everything burns
Everything burns
Light it up, let's go,
light it up, let's go
Everything burns
Light it up, let's go,
light it up, let's go
I'm on fire,
burnin' brighter than
anyone alive
I'm way too hot to touch,
so just remember if you try
Everything burns
Everything burns
